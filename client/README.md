This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
I've got it on a unique port number to make sure there are no conflicts with other stuff you may have running. Navigate to port `http://localhost:9657` to see it. You can make front end changes and upon saving to `App.js` you'll see this page hot reload! Thanks facebook/react!
